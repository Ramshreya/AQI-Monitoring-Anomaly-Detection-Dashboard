# AQI-Monitoring-Anomaly-Detection-Dashboard
A real-time AQI Monitoring and Anomaly Detection project using Python. The system fetches live AQI data, generates a 3-month time-series dataset, visualizes trends, and detects pollution spikes using statistical anomaly detection. Includes a clean dashboard for analysis.
This project focuses on monitoring Air Quality Index (AQI) for Hyderabad and detecting unusual pollution spikes using basic data science and machine learning techniques.
It follows a complete end-to-end AI workflow:

Live AQI data collection
Time-series dataset creation (3 months)
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Trend visualization
Anomaly detection (Z-score based)
Dashboard visualization (Jupyter / Streamlit optional)
This project demonstrates real-world skills in data engineering, analysis, anomaly detection, and data visualization.

1. Live AQI Data Collection
real-time AQI reading is fetched from the WAQI API and stored in aqi_live_base.csv.

2. Building a 3-Month Dataset
Since live AQI changes slowly, a 3-month hourly dataset was generated by simulating realistic AQI variations around the live value.
Random pollution spikes were added to represent anomalies.

3. Data Preprocessing
Convert datetime to proper format
Sort by time
Remove duplicates
Check missing values

4. Trend Visualization
line plot is created to show AQI changes over 3 months.

5. Anomaly Detection
Z-score based method is used:

z = (x - mean) / std
If |z| > 3 → anomaly

Detected anomalies (pollution spikes) are highlighted in red on the plot.
6. Dashboard Visualization
The dashboard is implemented in:
Jupyter Notebook
